<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is my take on the classic game of Simon Says! <em>Beat all 12 levels and brag to all of your friends.</em></p>
<p>This was my first project intended for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. It is coded in HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. This game primarily showcases my understanding of asynchronous timing as well as DOM manipulation.</p>

<h3>How to Play</h3>
<p>It's very simple to play, and I made sure the instructions were shown on the browser at every point in the game. <br><br> Simply click the start button to begin Simon's sequence. Once it has played, you may click the tiles in the order that was shown. If you do so correctly, you progress to the next level. If you are successful in the 12th level, you've beat the game! If you don't make it to the 12th level, don't fret. Your high score is displayed at the top of the page so you know what to beat next time. ðŸ˜‰ Enjoy! </p>
